//! `raea notes check` (docs/direction.feature DR6): each ask's check run as a rule on the work as it stands, through
//! `raea check`'s run (apps/direction, which the CLI lends). An ask's check must fail first: one that passes on its
//! first run is refused, as it isn't measuring the ask, and the work may change only once it has failed. What each run
//! found is kept (state.rs); `raea check` keeps it too, when it runs the notes' checks beside its rules. An ask the
//! person signs gets its clip cut here, from its composition's newest render.
