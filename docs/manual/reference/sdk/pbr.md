---

`<StandardMaterial>` is Bevy's physically based material, with its fields named as Bevy names them (`base_color`,
`perceptual_roughness`, `metallic`, `emissive` and the rest). An `ExtendedMaterial` adds a shader extension on top of
it; `ToonMaterial` and the paint and wear extensions give stylised looks; `ShaderMesh` and `SurfaceShader` take your
own shader. Fog, volumetric fog, decals and fire are here too.

```tsx
import { Sphere } from "raea/3d";
import { Mesh3d } from "raea/mesh";
import { StandardMaterial } from "raea/pbr";

const Ball = () => (
  <Mesh3d>
    <Sphere radius={0.5} />
    <StandardMaterial base_color="#c03030" perceptual_roughness={0.2} metallic={0.1} clearcoat={1} />
  </Mesh3d>
);
```

```ts
import { AmbientOcclusion, Decal, ExtendedMaterial, Fire } from "raea/pbr"
```

`raea/pbr` exports 22 components, 1 function, 1 value, 35 types. Bevy's counterpart: `bevy_pbr, bevy_material`. Source: [sdk/raea/src/pbr.ts](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/src/pbr.ts).

## Components

### `AmbientOcclusion`

Screen-space ambient occlusion: creases, corners and the ground under things darken where the sky's and the room's
light can't reach. It darkens ambient and environment light (an <AmbientLight>, an <Environment>), not the direct
light of a sun or a lamp. Turns multisampling off, so the edges are smoothed by SMAA instead (see <AntiAliasing>).
Put it inside the Canvas3D, once; each frame's is its own, so a shot can have it and the next not.

Bevy: `bevy_pbr::ssao::ScreenSpaceAmbientOcclusion`.

Takes [`AmbientOcclusionProps`](3d.md#ambientocclusionprops)'s props.

### `Decal`

A picture pressed onto whatever surface it lies across: a label on a jar, a stain on a counter, tiles on a wall, a
sticker on a laptop (Bevy's forward decal; the camera gets a depth prepass for it). Placed and keyed like any part,
so it moves and fades with a render's clock and a game's play alike.

Bevy: `bevy_pbr::mesh_material::MeshMaterial3d<bevy_pbr::extended_material::ExtendedMaterial<bevy_pbr::pbr_material::StandardMaterial, bevy_pbr::decal::forward::ForwardDecalMaterialExt>>`.

Takes [`DecalProps`](3d.md#decalprops)'s props.

### `ExtendedMaterial`

Bevy's ExtendedMaterial: a StandardMaterial with one of raea's extensions (GridExtension, PaintExtension, ToonExtension) drawn on it.

  <ExtendedMaterial base={<StandardMaterial base_color="#cfc8bb" />} extension={<GridExtension cell={0.5} major={2} />} />

Bevy: `bevy_pbr::ExtendedMaterial`.

| Prop | Type | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `base` (required) | `ReactElement` | a <StandardMaterial>, or another <ExtendedMaterial> to put a second extension on (grid and paint both) |
| `extension` (required) | `ReactElement` | a <GridExtension>, <PaintExtension> or <ToonExtension> |

Used in: [shader/extended_material](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/bench/bevy-parity/shader/extended_material.tsx), [shader/extended_material_bindless](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/bench/bevy-parity/shader/extended_material_bindless.tsx).

### `Fire`

A fire: a flame drawn as a volume, its tongues rising, curling and tearing off as it burns, with a flickering light
on its surroundings. Every pixel of it is a function of the frame (rising 3D noise in a tapering envelope), so a
render of any frame equals its play. Stand it on its fuel (a pyre, a brazier); put embers and smoke round it
yourself.

Bevy: `bevy_pbr::mesh_material::MeshMaterial3d<raea_render::engine::fire::FireMaterial>`.

Takes [`FireProps`](3d.md#fireprops)'s props.

### `Fog`

Distance fog: far things fade into `color`. Inside the <Camera3d> it is Bevy's DistanceFog on that camera, with all of
Bevy's fields (an atmospheric falloff, the sun's colour); inside the Canvas3D it fogs the scene's camera by near, far
or density.

Bevy: `bevy_pbr::fog::DistanceFog`.

Takes [`FogProps`](3d.md#fogprops)'s props.

### `FogVolume`

A box of air that light shows in: dust in a sunbeam, smoke, a haze of blood. Needs a <VolumetricFog> in the
Canvas3D; lights marked `volumetric` throw shafts through it, and every light's glow fills it softly. A part, so it
keeps its name across frames: animate its density, colour and placement.

Bevy: `bevy_light::volumetric::FogVolume`.

Takes [`FogVolumeProps`](3d.md#fogvolumeprops)'s props.

Used in: [3d/fog_volumes](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/bench/bevy-parity/3d/fog_volumes.tsx).

### `GridExtension`

raea's grid over a StandardMaterial, as an ExtendedMaterial's extension (engine/render grid.rs):

Bevy: `bevy_pbr::mesh_material::MeshMaterial3d<bevy_pbr::extended_material::ExtendedMaterial<bevy_pbr::pbr_material::StandardMaterial, raea_render::engine::grid::Grid>>`.

| Prop | Type | What it does |

| `major` | `number` | cells between heavier lines (4) |
| `color` | `string` | the lines' colour |
| `edge` | `string` | the colour each Box face is outlined in ("" for none) |

### `Lightmap`

A light bake on the meshes of a <Model> its `mesh` names, lighting them in place of the scene's lights, scaled by
their material's lightmap_exposure (a <StandardMaterial lightmap_exposure> in the same Model, by material). Goes in
a <Model>.

Bevy: `bevy_pbr::lightmap::Lightmap`.

| Prop | Type | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mesh` (required) | `string` | the glTF mesh it lies on, by name (Bevy's GltfMeshName): every primitive of it |
| `image` (required) | `string` | the bake: a.ktx2 (or other picture) file, staticFile("lightmaps/room.ktx2"), sampled by the mesh's second UVs |
| `uv_rect` | `{ min: [number, number]; max: [number, number] }` | the rect in the image those UVs are relative to, for meshes packed in one atlas ({ min: [0, 0], max: [1, 1] } by default) |
| `bicubic_sampling` | `boolean` | bicubic sampling: smoother, slower, may leak light (false by default) |

Used in: [3d/lightmaps](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/bench/bevy-parity/3d/lightmaps.tsx).

### `PaintExtension`

| Prop | Type | What it does |

| `breakup` | `number` | how far tone boundaries wander (0.5) |
| `scale` | `number` | the noise's size in metres (1) |
| `color` | `string` | the colour patches take |
| `amount` | `number` | how far toward `color` the patches go (0.6) |

### `ProceduralExtension`

raea's procedural surface over a StandardMaterial, as an ExtendedMaterial's extension (systems/procmat):

  <ExtendedMaterial base={<StandardMaterial />} extension={<ProceduralExtension pattern="brick" dirt={0.3} />} />

Bevy: `bevy_pbr::mesh_material::MeshMaterial3d<bevy_pbr::extended_material::ExtendedMaterial<bevy_pbr::pbr_material::StandardMaterial, raea_sys_procmat::Procedural>>`.

| Prop | Type | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pattern` (required) | `ProceduralSurface["pattern"]` | what it draws: noise, wood, marble, stone, brick, tiles, fabric, brushed or plaster |
| `colors` | `[string, string]` | the pattern's two colours |
| `scale` | `number` | how many metres across its features are |
| `rough_a` | `number` | the first colour's roughness, 0..1 |

| `dirt_color` | `string` | the dirt's colour |
| `seed` | `number` | which randomness the pattern uses |

### `Refinish`

Every <Model> inside re-covered: each of its glTF materials (all, or the one each names by `material`) given the
colour, texture or finish each gives, the rest of it kept (a run of cabinets painted, the doors and drawers with them;
`map: null` takes the wood's picture off). A model's own <MeshStandardMaterial> children go first.

| Prop | Type | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `materials` (required) | `MeshStandardMaterialProps[]` | the finishes, each a <MeshStandardMaterial>'s props, over every glTF material or the one its `material` names |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | the models refinished |

### `ShaderExtension`

Also takes the props of [`SurfaceShaderSpec`](3d.md#surfaceshaderspec).

Used in: [shader/extended_material](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/bench/bevy-parity/shader/extended_material.tsx), [shader/extended_material_bindless](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/bench/bevy-parity/shader/extended_material_bindless.tsx).

### `ShaderMesh`

A mesh drawn by a material written here in WESL or WGSL: one generic Bevy material
(rdb's ShaderMaterial, an AsBindGroup of 16 uniform slots and 4 textures) whose fragment shader is this source, so
a dissolve, a toon ramp, a hologram or a procedural pattern needs no Rust. Uniforms may change from frame to frame
(they're set again on any frame where they change); the shader isn't compiled again (#28).

Bevy: `bevy_pbr::mesh_material::MeshMaterial3d<raea_sys_material::shader_material::ShaderMaterial>`.

Takes [`ShaderMeshProps`](3d.md#shadermeshprops)'s props.

### `Splat`

A gaussian splat: a reconstructed scene or object, drawn back to front for the frame's camera, behind any mesh in
front of it, through the frame's look. Animate it with reveal, assemble, disperse, explode, wave, twist, morph and
pulse, all values of the frame.

Bevy: `bevy_pbr::mesh_material::MeshMaterial3d<raea_render::engine::splat::SplatMaterial>`, `bevy_pbr::mesh_material::MeshMaterial3d<raea_render::engine::splat::SplatMask>`.

Takes [`SplatProps`](3d.md#splatprops)'s props.

### `StandardMaterial`

Bevy's StandardMaterial for the Mesh3d it's inside. Unlit draws as MeshBasicMaterial; a clearcoat or transmission
as MeshPhysicalMaterial; anything else as MeshStandardMaterial, all on Bevy's StandardMaterial in the engine.

Bevy: `bevy_pbr::pbr_material::StandardMaterial`.

Also takes the props of [`StandardMaterialProps`](#standardmaterialprops).

Used in: [ui/render_ui_to_texture](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/bench/bevy-parity/ui/render_ui_to_texture.tsx), [ui/widgets/viewport_node](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/bench/bevy-parity/ui/widgets/viewport_node.tsx), [3d/fog](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/bench/bevy-parity/3d/fog.tsx), [3d/vertex_colors](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/bench/bevy-parity/3d/vertex_colors.tsx), [3d/rotate_environment_map](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/bench/bevy-parity/3d/rotate_environment_map.tsx), [3d/transparency_3d](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/bench/bevy-parity/3d/transparency_3d.tsx), [3d/spherical_area_lights](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/bench/bevy-parity/3d/spherical_area_lights.tsx), [3d/lightmaps](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/bench/bevy-parity/3d/lightmaps.tsx), and 41 more.

### `SurfaceShader`

One shader over every lit standard surface in the scene that has none of its own (meshes, Models' materials,
Characters), so the whole scene shares one look. Unlit, toon, paint, flat and looked
surfaces and ShaderMesh keep theirs. In the 3D beside the camera; one per scene.

Bevy: `bevy_pbr::mesh_material::MeshMaterial3d<bevy_pbr::extended_material::ExtendedMaterial<bevy_pbr::pbr_material::StandardMaterial, raea_sys_shader::ShaderExt>>`.

Takes [`SurfaceShaderSpec`](3d.md#surfaceshaderspec)'s props.

### `ThreeShaderMaterial`

A three.js shader on the mesh it's in, as it is: a ShaderMaterial's GLSL (or a node material's WGSL) with its
uniforms, drawn by raea's engine with three's built-ins. `<R3F>` makes these from an R3F scene's materials.

Takes [`ThreeShaderMaterialProps`](3d.md#threeshadermaterialprops)'s props.

### `ToonExtension`

Also takes the props of [`ToonExtensionProps`](#toonextensionprops).

### `ToonMaterial`

raea's ToonMaterial: a StandardMaterial's colour, texture and emission drawn in bands, as
`<ExtendedMaterial base={<StandardMaterial />} extension={<ToonExtension />} />` is (the old MeshToonMaterial).

Bevy: `bevy_pbr::mesh_material::MeshMaterial3d<bevy_pbr::extended_material::ExtendedMaterial<bevy_pbr::pbr_material::StandardMaterial, raea_render::engine::toon::ToonExt>>`, `bevy_pbr::mesh_material::MeshMaterial3d<raea_render::engine::toon::OutlineMaterial>`.

Also takes the props of [`StandardMaterialProps`](#standardmaterialprops) (`material`, `base_color`, `base_color_texture`, `emissive`, `alpha_mode`); [`ToonExtensionProps`](#toonextensionprops).

### `Volume`

A simulated volume: density and heat in a box, put in by its sources and puffs, lifted by heat, weighed down,
carried by the wind and its own curls, drawn lit and shadowed by itself. Smoke, a cloud or a contrail is a choice of
these (examples/volumes).
Simulated and raymarched by engine/render volume.rs:

Bevy: `bevy_pbr::mesh_material::MeshMaterial3d<raea_render::engine::volume::VolumeMaterial>`.

Takes [`VolumeProps`](3d.md#volumeprops)'s props.

### `VolumetricFog`

Volumetric fog on the camera: light in the air, drawn inside every <FogVolume>, with shafts from the lights marked
`volumetric`. Put it inside the Canvas3D, once; without it fog volumes draw nothing.

Bevy: `bevy_light::volumetric::VolumetricFog`, `bevy_light::volumetric::VolumetricLight`.

Takes [`VolumetricFogProps`](3d.md#volumetricfogprops)'s props.

Used in: [3d/fog_volumes](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/bench/bevy-parity/3d/fog_volumes.tsx).

### `WearExtension`

raea's chips, grime and rust over a StandardMaterial, as an ExtendedMaterial's extension (systems/wear):

Bevy: `bevy_pbr::mesh_material::MeshMaterial3d<bevy_pbr::extended_material::ExtendedMaterial<bevy_pbr::pbr_material::StandardMaterial, raea_sys_wear::Wear>>`.

| Prop | Type | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `amount` (required) | `number` | how worn it is, 0-1 |
| `scale` | `number` | a blotch's size in metres (0.08) |
| `chips` | `number` | chips on edges and a few spots, 0-1 of the wear (0.6) |
| `grime` | `number` | grime low and underneath, 0-1 of the wear (0.5) |
| `rust` | `number` | rust run down in streaks, 0-1 of the wear (0.25) |
| `seed` | `number` | moves the pattern |
| `chip_color` | `string` | what chips show beneath the paint |
| `grime_color` | `string` | the grime's colour |
| `rust_color` | `string` | the rust's colour |

## Functions

### `volumeShadow`

```ts
function volumeShadow(owner: string, v: unknown): number
```

## Values

### `FogFalloff`

FogFalloff's constructors: the visibility distance (5% contrast left at it by default) to a density

Used in: [3d/atmospheric_fog](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/bench/bevy-parity/3d/atmospheric_fog.tsx).

## Types

### `AlphaMode`

Bevy's AlphaMode, as it reflects.

```ts
type AlphaMode = "Opaque" | "Blend" | "Premultiplied" | "Add" | "Multiply" | "AlphaToCoverage" | { Mask: number }
```

### `AmbientOcclusionProps`

| Field | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quality` | `"low" \| "medium" \| "high" \| "ultra"` | how many samples a pixel takes: "low" (4), "medium" (8, the default), "high" (18), "ultra" (54) |
| `thickness` | `number` | how thick, in metres, a surface is taken to be behind what the camera sees (0.25 by default): larger darkens more behind thin things |

### `DecalProps`

| Field | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src` (required) | `string` | the picture pressed onto the surface: staticFile("label.png"); its clear parts show the surface through |
| `name` | `string` | the entity's name, for picking, the inspector and world.* |
| `normalMap` | `string` | a normal map pressed with the picture: the label's relief |
| `size` | `number \| [number, number]` | width by height in metres (a number: a square) |
| `position` | `Vec3` | where it stands, metres (x, y, z) |
| `normal` | `Vec3` | which way the surface faces at the decal (out of it; [0, 1, 0], a floor or counter, by default): turns the decal so the picture lies on it, upright on a wall, its top toward -z on a floor. Instead of rotation |
| `spin` | `number` | a turn about the normal (radians) |
| `rotation` | `Vec3` | radians, the decal's +y out of the surface (rather than normal) |
| `color` | `string` | a tint times the picture (keyed: a stain darkening) |
| `opacity` | `number` | 0 to 1 (keyed: a label fading in) |
| `roughness` | `number` | 0..1, smooth to matte |
| `metalness` | `number` | 0..1, a dielectric to a metal |
| `unlit` | `boolean` | drawn in its flat colour, without light or shade |
| `fade` | `number` | how far off its plane (metres) it still lies on a surface, fading to nothing there (0.05 by default). Anything nearer the plane than this takes it, a cabinet's side or a fridge's as well as the wall: keep it small |

### `ExtendedMaterialProps`

The props of [`ExtendedMaterial`](#extendedmaterial), tabled there.

### `FireProps`

| Field | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `string` | parts are matched by name across frames: name a fire that comes and goes |
| `position` | `Vec3` | the flame's foot: where it stands on its fuel |
| `scale` | `number \| Vec3` | its size in metres: one number for its height (it's half as wide), or [width, height, depth] (1 by default) |
| `intensity` | `number` | how bright its core is, as a material's emissiveIntensity (6 by default): 3 a guttering fire, 10-20 a roaring one in the dark. Values over 1 bloom under a <Bloom> |
| `color` | `string` | the flame's body (orange, "#ff7a1f", by default); its edges go deep red and its core yellow-white |
| `seed` | `number` | which flame: fires with different seeds don't flicker together (0 by default) |
| `speed` | `number` | how fast its tongues rise, 1 by default (a big fire's rise more slowly than a small one's on their own) |
| `time` | `number` | seconds on its clock (by default the Sequence's time: frame / fps) |
| `steps` | `number` | samples along each ray through it (48 by default): fewer is cheaper and blurrier |
| `opacity` | `number` | how much of what's behind it its body hides (1 by default): raise it (3-6) in daylight, where a bright wall behind would wash out a flame that only adds light |
| `light` | `number` | the light it casts on what's around it: a flickering PointLight's intensity (1 by default; 0 for none) |

### `FogProps`

| Field | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `color` | `FogColor` | what far things fade into: match the background |
| `near` | `number` | linear fog from `near` to `far` (in the Canvas3D 5 and 20 by default; on the camera Bevy's 0 and 100) |
| `far` | `number` | where linear fog is full, from the camera (20 in the Canvas3D, 100 on a camera) |
| `density` | `number` | or exponential fog of this density (0.05-0.3), instead of near and far |
| `falloff` | `FogFalloff` | on the camera: Bevy's FogFalloff, in place of near, far and density (Bevy's default Linear 0 to 100) |
| `directional_light_color` | `FogColor` | on the camera: the sun's colour in the fog looking towards it, its alpha its strength (Bevy's default none) |
| `directional_light_exponent` | `number` | on the camera: how tight the sun's glow is (Bevy's default 8) |

### `FogVolumeProps`

| Field | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `string` | parts are matched by name across frames: name a volume that comes and goes |
| `position` | `Vec3` | the box's centre |
| `rotation` | `Vec3` | radians |
| `scale` | `number \| Vec3` | the box's size in metres: one number for a cube, or [x, y, z] (1 by default) |
| `density` | `number` | how thick the air is (0.1 by default: dusty; 0.02 a faint haze; 0.5 smoke). Animate it to let dust settle, smoke roll in or a volume vanish (0) |
| `color` | `string` | the fog's own colour, what light scattering out of it takes on (white by default; a dark red for blood in the air) |
| `absorption` | `number` | how much light it swallows (0.3 by default): higher reads as soot or smoke |
| `scattering` | `number` | how much light it throws back toward the eye (0.3 by default): higher reads as bright dust or mist |
| `anisotropy` | `number` | how far forward it scatters, -1 to 1 (0.5 by default): near 1 the shafts glow when you look toward the light |
| `falloff` | `number` | how fast it thins going up, per metre from the box's floor (0 by default: even throughout): 0.5 is a ground fog that's a third as thick two metres up. A box wide and tall with a falloff is height fog. Only <VolumetricFog mode="froxel"> draws it; the march draws the box evenly |
| `density_texture` | `string` | Bevy's density_texture: a 3D.ktx2 image in the media folder whose values scale the density through the box (a cloud, a bunny of smoke); the box draws evenly without one. Only the march draws it |

### `GridExtensionProps`

raea's extension of StandardMaterial (a Bevy MaterialExtension of raea's): graph paper over the surface for
greybox levels, lines every `cell` world units (fixed in the world, so they run on across shapes), a heavier one
every `major` cells (4), in `color`, and each face of a Box outlined in `edge` ("" for no outlines). Its colours are
the first frame's. It goes in an ExtendedMaterial's `extension`.

The props of [`GridExtension`](#gridextension), tabled there.

### `LightmapProps`

The props of [`Lightmap`](#lightmap), tabled there.

### `MetallicRoughnessMaps`

Separate greyscale maps packed into Bevy's metallic_roughness_texture when they load: the roughness map's grey as
its green, the metalness map's as its blue (white without one, so metallic is its factor exactly). Poly Haven's
"_rough" sets come this way; a packed "_arm" map is a plain path.

| Field | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `roughness` | `string` | a greyscale roughness map (white rough) |
| `metalness` | `string` | a greyscale metalness map (white metal) |

### `PaintExtensionProps`

raea's extension of StandardMaterial for a paint look (<Look mode="paint">): the surface broken up by world-space
noise of `scale` metres (1), its tone boundaries wandering by `breakup` (0.5) and patches of it taking `color`
(`amount`, 0.6, of the way): a mottled field, rust, a wall's uneven paint. It goes in an ExtendedMaterial's
`extension`.

The props of [`PaintExtension`](#paintextension), tabled there.

### `ProceduralExtensionProps`

raea's extension of StandardMaterial that draws a pattern on the GPU in place of its flat colour (the engine's
Procedural MaterialExtension, systems/procmat): `pattern` (noise, wood, marble, stone, brick, tiles, fabric,
brushed, plaster) in `colors` with roughness `rough_a`/`rough_b`, features `scale` metres across, a `bump`; brick
and tiles in `tile` [w, h] metre cells with `gap` metre joints in `gap_color`. Over it, each 0-1: `dust` on what
faces up, `dirt` in joints, hollows, undersides and the floor line, `edges` worn lighter. The pattern overrides the
base's colour and roughness; its lighting stays. It goes in an ExtendedMaterial's `extension`, alone.

The props of [`ProceduralExtension`](#proceduralextension), tabled there.

### `SampledImage`

A picture read with its own sampler: Bevy's load_with_settings, whose ImageLoaderSettings give the Image its
ImageSamplerDescriptor ({ path: "checker.png", sampler: { filter: "nearest" } } for hard pixels).

| Field | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` (required) | `string` | the picture, in the media folder |
| `sampler` (required) | `SamplerSpec` | how it's sampled: filter, address modes |

### `ShaderExtensionProps`

raea's extension of StandardMaterial written in WESL: its
`fn surface` runs before Bevy's lighting and its `fn lit` after it, on the base's inputs, so the surface stays lit
and shadowed. raea/3d's <MeshStandardMaterial shader> is the same thing; the spec is SurfaceShaderSpec. It goes in an
ExtendedMaterial's `extension`, alone.

Bevy: `bevy_pbr::extended_material::ExtendedMaterial<bevy_pbr::pbr_material::StandardMaterial, raea_sys_shader::ShaderExt>`.

The props of [`ShaderExtension`](#shaderextension), tabled there.

### `ShaderMeshProps`

| Field | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |

A <Material>'s may also bind one binding_array<texture_2d<f32>>, a list of 1 to 16 pictures (Bevy's texture_binding_array; a GPU without texture binding arrays refuses it) |

| `turbulenceSize` | `number` | the turbulence's size in metres (2) |
| `steps` | `number` | samples along each ray (96) |
| `shadow` | `boolean \| number` | its shadow, cast in the scene's light as a mesh's is (on by default): soft moving shadows on the ground, meshes and models under it, and, with a `volumetric` sun and a <FogVolume> under <VolumetricFog>, the sun's shafts breaking through the gaps between clouds. The shadow is where the volume has stopped half the sun; a number scales the density it sees: 1 as drawn, more reaches into its thinner parts (a fatter shadow; up to 4, a thin contrail's made to show), less keeps to the dense cores. false or 0 casts none. Under a paint look the shadow is the painted shape. Soften its edge with the sun's `softShadow` (2-4 for clouds) |

### `VolumeSource`

where density and heat come in: a burner, or an engine moving `at` -> `to` (a contrail)

| Field | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `at` (required) | `Vec3` | where (metres from the box's foot), and where it has moved to by `until` if it moves |
| `to` | `Vec3` | where a moving source has got to by `until` |
| `from` | `number` | when it puts out, seconds ([0, Infinity]) |
| `until` | `number` | when it stops putting out, seconds (Infinity) |
| `radius` | `number` | its radius (0.5 m); the density and heat it puts out a second at its centre (4 and 4); the velocity it pushes out with, m/s ([0, 0, 0]) |
| `rate` | `number` | the density it puts out a second at its centre (4) |
| `heat` | `number` | the heat it puts out a second at its centre (4) |
| `speed` | `Vec3` | the velocity it pushes out with, m/s ([0, 0, 0]) |

### `VolumetricFogProps`

| Field | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `steps` | `number` | mode="march": samples along each ray through a fog volume (64 by default): too few stair-step a shaft's edges, so 128 for a render with hard-edged shafts, or 32 with `dither`; about 0.1 ms a step at 1920x1080 on an M5 Pro |
| `dither` | `boolean` | mode="march": start each pixel's march a fraction of a step in, by a fixed noise seeded from the pixel and the frame number (false by default): the shafts' steps become fine grain instead of bands, so fewer steps look smooth. The noise is a function of the frame, so a render still equals its play |
| `resolution` | `number` | mode="march": the fraction of the frame's resolution the fog is marched at (1 by default): 0.5 marches a quarter of the pixels and puts the result over the frame guided by depth, so an edge in front of a shaft keeps no fog from what's behind it. 0.5, 1/3 or 0.25; each frame on its own, so a render still equals its play |
| `ambient` | `number` | light the fog has everywhere, lit or not (0 by default). Bevy lights a volume's whole box with it whatever its density, so the box's edges show: keep it 0, or small with the camera inside the volume |
| `ambientColor` | `string` | that light's colour (white by default) |
| `mode` | `"march" \| "froxel"` | how the fog is drawn: "froxel" (the default: every volume written into one grid of cells along the view, lit once a cell and integrated front to back once, with the `hero` lights' shafts integrated exactly along epipolar lines: no steps, no dither, its cost the grid's whatever the resolution or the number of volumes, overlapping volumes mixed as one medium, see-through surfaces fogged at their own depth) or "march" (Bevy's ray march through each volume, as before). `steps`, `dither` and `resolution` are the march's; `slices`, `tile`, `samples` and `hero` the grid's |
| `slices` | `number` | the grid's cells along the view, spaced evenly in log depth from the camera to the farthest volume (64 by default; 32 to 256) |
| `tile` | `number` | the grid's cells across the frame, in pixels a side (16 by default; 4, 8 or 16) |
| `samples` | `number` | points lit in each cell, spread along its depth (1 by default; 1 to 8): more keeps thin shadows in the grid's soft light (a hero light's shafts don't need them) |
| `hero` | `boolean` | the grid's shafts: true (the default) integrates the first two volumetric spot lights and the first two volumetric directional lights exactly, over their shadow maps texel by texel, so a blind's bars or a doorway's edge are as crisp as the shadow map: integrated at samples along lines from the light across the frame (Chen et al.'s epipolar sampling), more of them where the depth or the light changes, and each pixel read from the samples either side of it at its depth; false lights them in the grid's cells with the rest |

### `WearExtensionProps`

raea's extension of StandardMaterial that wears it (the engine's Wear MaterialExtension, systems/wear): its paint
mottled, chipped back to `chip_color` on edges and a few spots, `grime` gathered low and underneath and `rust` run
down in streaks, fixed in the part's own space as it moves. `amount` 0-1; `chips`, `grime` and `rust` each 0-1 of it
(0.6, 0.5, 0.25); `scale` a blotch's size in metres (0.08); `seed` moves the pattern. It goes in an
ExtendedMaterial's `extension`.
