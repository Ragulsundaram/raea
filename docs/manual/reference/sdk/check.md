summary: "A check written as a system over a composition's world: what `raea check` runs for a rule a controller holds."

---

A check holds the work to one line. It is a system over each frame's world, the same world
[`raea world`](../cli/world.md) prints: a caption, a footage cut, a sound cue and a 3D part are entities with
components, so one check reads the same for any of them. It finds entities, measures, and calls `found` for each
thing that breaks its line; it never prints. A rule in a project's controller names it by its path, with its values,
and [`raea check`](../cli/check.md) runs it on every composition, on the frames it says it ranges over. A check that
reads what only a render has (`needs: "render"`) waits for one, and says so. raea's own checks are the same thing
written in Rust, under the names `text-hold`, `text-above`, `text-below`, `text-margin`, `loudness`, `still-max`,
`text-read` and `floor`.

```ts
// controllers/rules.ts holds the rule:
//   { label: "Captions clear the button band", type: "rule", check: "../checks/caption.ts", values: { band: 0.8 } }

// checks/caption.ts
import { check, found, type Layer, type Text } from "raea/check";

export default check({ id: "caption", text: "a caption clears the platform's button band" }, (world, _frame, values) => {
  const band = Number(values.band ?? 0.8);
  for (const t of world.find({ with: ["Text", "Layer"] })) {
    if (world.component<Layer>(t, "Layer")!.medium !== "2d-type") continue;
    const box = world.component<Text>(t, "Text")!.box; // in frame fractions: left, top, right, bottom
    if (box && box[3] > band) found({ about: [t], says: `the caption reaches ${Math.round(box[3] * 100)}% down the frame` });
  }
});
```

```ts
import { check, declared, found, runChecks } from "raea/check"
```

`raea/check` exports 5 functions, 1 class, 36 types. Source: [sdk/raea/src/check.ts](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/src/check.ts).

## Functions

### `check`

A check: what it holds the work to, and the system that finds where the work doesn't hold.

```ts
function check(meta: CheckMeta, run: CheckFn): Check
```

### `declared`

Each check's declaration, as raea check reads it before it reads any frame.

```ts
function declared(checks: Check[]): CheckMeta[]
```

### `found`

Says what the running check found. Only inside a check's system, as raea check runs it.

```ts
function found(f: Found): void
```

### `runChecks`

Every planned check run on its frames' worlds: what they found, a run of frames finding the same thing as one
finding over those frames, and each check that threw, with what it threw.

```ts
function runChecks(checks: Check[], plan: Planned[], worlds: Facts[]): { findings: Finding[]; threw: { check: string; says: string; }[]; }
```

### `worldOf`

A frame's facts as a raea/ecs world: the same components, the frame's size and rate as the `Frame` resource, and
what the render added as resources. An entity's references to others (a Covered's `layer`, a relation's `to`)
are its id in this world.

```ts
function worldOf(facts: Facts): World
```

## Classes

### `World`

A world of entities: rows in tables by kind.

| Member | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `new World(store?: Store \| undefined)` | A world on `store`: the engine's tables when it has them, else TypeScript's (createWorld picks for you). |
| `.native: boolean` | whether the tables are the engine's (native) or TypeScript's |
| `.spawn(kind: string, cols?: Cols): number` | A new entity of `kind` with its columns; its id. |
| `.set(id: number, cols: Cols): void` | Columns set on an entity. |
| `.get(id: number): Row` | An entity's row. |
| `.despawn(id: number): void` | An entity taken out of the world, with its children. |
| `.query(kind: string, where?: Where): number[]` | The ids of `kind`'s entities whose columns pass every condition, filtered by the engine. |
| `.column(kind: string, col: string): (number \| null)[]` | One numeric column of `kind`, in id order (null where unset). |
| `.count(kind: string): number` | How many entities of `kind` there are. |
| `.rows(): Row[]` | Every row, by kind then id. |
| `.add(components: Components, opts?: { parent?: number \| undefined; }): number` | A new entity with components ({Position: {x, y}, Ball: {}}), optionally a child of `parent`. |
| `.insert(id: number, components: Components): void` | Components added to (or replacing those on) an entity. |
| `.remove(id: number, ...names: string[]): void` | Components taken off an entity. |
| `.components(id: number): Components` | An entity's components by name. |
| `.component<T = Record<string, Value>>(id: number, name: string): T \| undefined` | One component of an entity (undefined when it hasn't it). |
| `.find(f: Find): number[]` | Entities with every `with` component and no `without` one, passing every condition ("Comp.field", or a field of the first `with`), in id order: Bevy's query in the engine. |
| `.setParent(id: number, parent: number \| null): void` | An entity's parent (despawning a parent despawns its children). |
| `.parent(id: number): number \| null` | An entity's parent (null when it has none). |
| `.children(id: number): number[]` | An entity's children's ids. |
| `.resource<T = unknown>(name: string, value?: T \| undefined): T \| null` | A resource: one value for the world (set it with a value; null when unset). |
| `.send(name: string, value?: unknown): void` | An event for the systems after this one, this frame (each frame starts with none). |
| `.events<T = unknown>(name: string): T[]` | This frame's events of a name, in the order sent. |
| `.scene(): unknown[]` | What draws: Mesh + Transform entities (world space, parents composed) and lights (`<Entities world={w.at(frame)} />` hands this to the renderer). From the engine's tables natively; from the world's own store in a browser (raea-web), the same list as runtime/calls ecs.scene makes. |
| `.handle: number \| null` | The engine's id of this world's tables (for the renderer), or null under plain bun. |
| `.system(fn: System): World` | A system run on every frame, after the ones before it. |
| `.step(frame: number): void` | Run the systems once, for `frame`. |
| `.at(frame: number): World` | The world after frames 0..frame-1 have run (a copy; this world as built is the state before frame 0). |

```ts
type About = { name: string, key?: string, }
```

```

### `Found`

What a check found: the entities it is about, what it says, and, where they aren't the check's or the frame's,
its level and frames (its first, and the frame after its last); the number it turns on and the fix, when there
are.

| Field | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `about` | `number[]` | the entities it is about, by their ids in this frame's world |

| `fix` | `string` | what to change, when there is one thing to change |

### `Frames`

The frames a check runs on: every frame; the first frame of each shot after the first, and the frame before it;
every frame a line is said or sung on; once, on the first frame (for what is the piece's, as its mix); or these.

```ts
type Frames = "all" | "cuts" | "lines" | "once" | number[]
```

### `Layer`

```ts
type Picture = { luma: number, motion?: number, frames?: number, }
```

### `Pin`

```ts
type Pin = { t?: number, x?: number, y?: number, part?: string, }
```

### `Planned`

Which check runs on which frames with which values, as raea check plans it from a rule: the rule's level (none:
the check's own) and where the rule was written.

| Field | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
