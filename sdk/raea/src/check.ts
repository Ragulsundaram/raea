// raea/check: a check is a system over the world (docs/direction.feature DR4). `raea check` reads each composition's
// frames into worlds holding the components `raea world` prints (raea-core-facts; their types are facts.gen.ts,
// generated from the Rust), joins the composition's newest render, and runs every check that applies on the frames it
// says it ranges over. A check finds entities, measures, and calls `found`; it never prints. raea's own checks are
// the same thing written in Rust, run under the same names, and a check reads the same for a mesh, a caption, a cut
// or a cue: nothing here is 3D's.
//
//   // checks/clear.ts, run by a rule a controller holds:
//   //   { label: "Captions clear the button band", type: "rule", check: "../checks/clear.ts", values: { band: 0.8 } }
//   import { check, found, type Text } from "raea/check";
//   export default check({ id: "caption-clear", text: "Captions clear the button band" }, (world, frame, values) => {
//     for (const t of world.find({ with: ["Text", "Layer"] })) {
//       const box = world.component<Text>(t, "Text")?.box;
//       if (box && box[3] > Number(values.band ?? 0.8)) found({ about: [t], says: "the caption runs into the button band" });
//     }
