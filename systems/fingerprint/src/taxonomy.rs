//! The taxonomy (FP2b): a fingerprint's axes, each with the words people use for it, the modality its head reads,
//! its scope, polarity and the check it maps to. It's written in fingerprint.ts (`fingerprint({...})` from
//! "raea/brief", sdk/raea/src/fingerprint.ts) and read here as the JSON its default export evaluates to. raea's base
//! taxonomy is drawn from Shane's notes (docs/fingerprint.md): glitch and continuity, sound, pace, camera, cut, light
//! and look, realism and detail, design and type. Creative directions are never axes.
