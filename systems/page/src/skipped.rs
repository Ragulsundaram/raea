//! Whether Vello drew a scene at all. Past one of its bump buffers, Vello's fine stage returns before writing a texel
//! (vello_shaders fine.wgsl: `ptcl[0] == ~0u`) and `render_to_texture` still returns Ok, so the target keeps what it
//! held: a pooled layer texture its last frame's picture, a new one nothing (#23). A sentinel texel written at (0,0)
//! before the draw and read back after says which: the fine stage writes every texel when it runs, and never this one,
//! since its colour is straight (an alpha of 0 comes out with a colour of about 0, never magenta).
//! The read back isn't waited for (a wait on every draw cost a fifth of a render's speed): its answer comes in the
//! wait for the frame's own pixels. A skipped draw puts Vello's own bump sizes on for the rest of the process and is
//! counted (raea_gpu_device::check::skipped_draw), and the frame's check (`skip_checked`) draws the frames since again
//! at those sizes, or refuses one skipped at them too, so the render fails naming it.
//! RAEA_PAGE_DRAWN_CHECK=0 draws without the check (for measuring what it costs; a skipped draw goes unseen again).
//! And whether it drew every image: one that finds no room in Vello's image atlas is drawn at no size, again with no
//! error. A layer with a filter or a perspective transform is such an image, the size of its box, so a page of many
//! lost its nearest ones. The resolve counts them (vendor/vello_encoding `take_images_left_out`) and the frame is
//! refused (raea_gpu_device::check::refuse), so the render fails naming it.
